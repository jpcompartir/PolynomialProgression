# PolynomialProgression
Welcome to the personal website of Jack Penzer, Data Scientist & Data Science Mentor. I'll be storing interesting things I find in the data world, journaling my thoughts and documenting progress. A word on the name - I considered Linear/Logistic Progression, but given that progress is never linear, I thought Polynomial Progression was more fitting. 

I will endeavour to post regularly but will refrain from posting for the sake of posting, so expect fits and spurts of progress followed by deafening silence. 

## About Me
I've been working as a Data Scientist for ~2 years now, I work mainly in R & Python - selecting the appropriate language for the job at hand. I'm a self-taught programmer and prior to Data Science, I mainly did things with language. I've never looked back since taking the jump to self-teach programming and am incredibly grateful for the wonderful and infinite world of learning programming and Data Science have provided me - and I hope will continue to provide!

## What You'll Find Here
If I specialise in anything, it's natural language processing (NLP), so you will often find posts to do with what's hot in the industry, models I'm building/have built or the frameworks I'm using or am interested in. Other things I'm likely to post about will be cool snippets of code, automating things, code benchmarking/profiling and simulations. I hope I'll find the time to analyse some sports data this year and post findings here, do feel free to comment if you find anything interesting, wish to make a correction, or just fancy chatting about data things.

I do not profess to originality or ownership of the content created herein, so if anything seems like it should have an attribution or reference, please don't hesitate to pull me up on it - it's hard (impossible) to keep track of all the things one reads and who said what first.

Enough of the self-aggrandising pre-amble, I hope the rest of this site is considerably more interesting.
