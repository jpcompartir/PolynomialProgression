      <h1 id="polynomialprogression">PolynomialProgression</h1>
<p>Welcome to the personal website of Jack Penzer, Data Scientist &amp; Data Science Mentor. I&rsquo;ll be storing interesting things I find in the data world, journaling my thoughts and documenting progress. A word on the name - I considered Linear/Logistic Progression, but given that progress is never linear, I thought Polynomial Progression was more fitting.</p>
<p>I will endeavour to post regularly but will refrain from posting for the sake of posting, so expect fits and spurts of progress followed by deafening silence.</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working as a Data Scientist for ~2 years now, I work mainly in R &amp; Python - selecting the appropriate language for the job at hand. I&rsquo;m a self-taught programmer and prior to Data Science, I mainly did things with language. I&rsquo;ve never looked back since taking the jump to self-teach programming and am incredibly grateful for the wonderful and infinite world of learning programming and Data Science have provided me - and I hope will continue to provide!</p>
<h2 id="what-youll-find-here">What You&rsquo;ll Find Here</h2>
<p>If I specialise in anything, it&rsquo;s natural language processing (NLP), so you will often find posts to do with what&rsquo;s hot in the industry, models I&rsquo;m building/have built or the frameworks I&rsquo;m using or am interested in. Other things I&rsquo;m likely to post about will be cool snippets of code, automating things, code benchmarking/profiling and simulations. I hope I&rsquo;ll find the time to analyse some sports data this year and post findings here, do feel free to comment if you find anything interesting, wish to make a correction, or just fancy chatting about data things.</p>
<p>I do not profess to originality or ownership of the content created herein, so if anything seems like it should have an attribution or reference, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to pull me up on it - it&rsquo;s hard (impossible) to keep track of all the things one reads and who said what first.</p>
<p>Enough of the self-aggrandising pre-amble, I hope the rest of this site is considerably more interesting.</p>
